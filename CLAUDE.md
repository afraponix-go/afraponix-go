## Recent Session Work Summary

### ✅ Completed Tasks

#### 1. **Grow Bed Planting Summary on Overview Tab** 📊
- **Issue**: Overview tab lacked detailed information about grow bed utilization and planting progress, and summary wasn't updating after new plant entries
- **Solution**: 
  - Added comprehensive grow bed summary section showing allocation vs actual planting data
  - Displays each grow bed with area, allocation percentage, and planting progress
  - Shows plant counts (actual vs allocated) with visual progress bars
  - Color-coded progress indicators (green ≥80%, yellow ≥50%, red <50%)
  - Individual crop breakdown per bed showing planted vs allocated counts
  - Clean custom crop names using existing cleanCustomCropName() method
  - Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
  - **Fixed real-time updates**: Summary now refreshes immediately after plant/harvest entries
  - **Fresh data fetching**: Summary fetches latest plant data directly from API instead of cached data
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:4194` - Made updatePlantOverview async
  - `/script.js:1039,2993` - Updated function calls to handle async
  - `/script.js:4244-4386` - New generateGrowBedSummary() and helper methods
  - `/script.js:1305-1308,1346-1349` - Added data refresh after plant/harvest recording
  - `/script.js:4261-4264` - Modified to fetch fresh plant data instead of using cache
  - `/script.js:4293-4300` - Fixed grow bed ID filtering with type coercion (== instead of ===)
  - `/script.js:4277-4308` - Added comprehensive debugging to identify data mismatches
  - `/style.css:5984-6178` - Comprehensive CSS styling for grow bed summary
- **Result**: Overview tab shows detailed grow bed utilization with real-time updates and proper data filtering

#### 2. **Custom Crop Name Cleanup** 🧹
- **Issue**: Custom crop names were displaying with unwanted suffixes like usernames (e.g., "Purple_basil_justin")
- **Root Cause**: Custom crop names in database included user identifiers that shouldn't be shown in UI
- **Solution**: 
  - Created `cleanCustomCropName()` method to clean display names
  - Removes common patterns like usernames, admin suffixes, test identifiers
  - Converts underscores to spaces for better readability
  - Applied cleaning to all custom crop displays: allocation dropdowns, custom crops tab, edit forms
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:8117,8159` - Applied cleaning to allocation dropdowns
  - `/script.js:8547` - Applied cleaning to custom crops display cards
  - `/script.js:8579` - Applied cleaning to dropdown updates
  - `/script.js:8007-8015` - Applied cleaning to allocation display cards
  - `/script.js:8314-8322` - Applied cleaning to edit form headers
  - `/script.js:4282-4295` - Applied cleaning to plant history displays
  - `/script.js:1303,1339` - Applied cleaning to success notification messages
  - `/script.js:1199,1260` - Applied cleaning to plant/harvest dropdown options
  - `/script.js:4422-4423` - Applied cleaning to plant detail displays
  - `/script.js:8189-8213` - New cleanCustomCropName() method
- **Result**: Custom crops now display clean names everywhere (e.g., "Purple Basil" instead of "Purple_basil_justin")

#### 2. **Custom Crops in Allocation Dropdown** 🌿
- **Issue**: Crop allocation dropdown only showed hardcoded standard crops, excluding user-added custom crops
- **Root Cause**: Custom crop data structure used `crop.crop_name` but allocation code was looking for `crop.name`
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `displayPlantAllocations()` to be async and fetch custom crops
  - Created `generateCropOptionsHtml()` to dynamically build crop options including custom crops
  - Created `generateEditCropOptionsHtml()` for edit forms with proper selection handling
  - Fixed custom crop field references to use correct `crop.crop_name` property
  - Standardized crop value format using `crop_name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '_')`
  - Updated both add and edit allocation forms to include custom crops
  - Added automatic refresh of allocation dropdowns when custom crops are added/deleted
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:7967-7972` - Made displayPlantAllocations async and dynamic
  - `/script.js:8044` - Replaced hardcoded options with dynamic HTML
  - `/script.js:8081-8129` - New generateCropOptionsHtml() method with correct field references
  - `/script.js:8131-8172` - New generateEditCropOptionsHtml() method with correct field references
  - `/script.js:8229-8235` - Made editAllocation async
  - `/script.js:8568-8580` - Fixed updateCropDropdowns to use correct field and format
  - `/script.js:8610-8628,8645-8652` - Added allocation refresh on custom crop changes
- **Result**: All custom crops now appear correctly in allocation dropdowns using their actual names from the custom crops tab

#### 2. **Crop Allocation Validation for Plant Management** 🌱
- **Issue**: Plant and harvest forms allowed selecting any crop type regardless of what was allocated to grow beds
- **Solution**: 
  - Created bed-specific crop filtering for both planting and harvesting
  - Plant dropdown now only shows crops allocated to the selected grow bed
  - Harvest dropdown only shows crops that are both allocated AND have been planted
  - Added user notifications when no crops are allocated to selected bed
  - Directs users to Settings → Crop Allocation tab when needed
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:1142-1153` - Enhanced bed selection with event listeners
  - `/script.js:1157-1264` - New `updatePlantCropDropdown()` and `updateHarvestCropDropdown()` functions
- **Result**: Users can now only select crops that have been properly allocated to specific grow beds

#### 2. **Notification System Fix** 🔔
- **Issue**: Notifications were being created but not visible due to CSS positioning conflicts
- **Root Cause**: CSS `position: static` was overriding `position: fixed` despite inline styles
- **Solution**: 
  - Enhanced `createNotificationContainer()` with aggressive inline styling
  - Added style re-enforcement at multiple points in the notification lifecycle
  - Force-applied critical styles with `!important` equivalent behavior
  - Added timeout-based style verification and re-application
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:308-361` - Enhanced container creation
  - `/script.js:420-473` - Improved notification visibility forcing
- **Result**: Toast notifications now appear correctly in top-right corner

#### 2. **Fish Count Synchronization** 🐟
- **Issue**: Overview tab showed 50 fish while Tank Information showed 0
- **Root Cause**: Database records with same date weren't sorted consistently
- **Solution**: Updated SQL queries to use `ORDER BY date DESC, created_at DESC`
- **Files Modified**: `/routes/data.js:142,316,325` - Fixed fish health data sorting
- **Result**: Fish counts now sync correctly between tabs

#### 3. **System Selection Persistence** 💾
- **Issue**: Selected system was lost on page refresh
- **Solution**: Implemented localStorage persistence for `activeSystemId`
- **Files Modified**: `/script.js` - Added localStorage save/restore in `switchToSystem()`
- **Result**: Selected system persists across page refreshes

#### 4. **Grow Bed Configuration Fix** 🌱
- **Issue**: Saving one grow bed deleted the other
- **Root Cause**: API was deleting all beds before inserting
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new PUT endpoint for single bed updates
  - Modified client to save all beds together when needed
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/routes/grow-beds.js:87-165` - Added single bed update endpoint
  - Client-side bed saving logic updated
- **Result**: Individual bed configurations save without affecting others

#### 5. **Error Handling Improvements** ⚠️
- Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (fishType)` in `getRecommendedStockingDensity()`
- Added null checks and fallback values
- **Files Modified**: `/script.js` - Added null check for fishType parameter

#### 6. **Harvest Form Validation Fix** ✅
- **Issue**: Harvest form showed "fill in all fields" error despite all fields being complete
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate HTML element IDs - both harvest form and fish calculator had `id="harvest-weight"`
- **Solution**: Renamed fish calculator weight field to `id="fish-harvest-weight"`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:5162` - Changed fish calculator weight field ID
  - `/script.js:5308,5317,5432` - Updated all references to use new ID
- **Result**: Harvest form validation now works correctly

#### 7. **Plant Count Calculation Fix** 🌱
- **Issue**: Harvested crops weren't showing in grow bed summary; lettuce showed 0 planted despite harvest of 10
- **Root Cause**: `getCropPlantCount()` was using harvest records (with count: 0) as planting records
- **Solution**: 
  - Added filter to separate planting entries from harvest entries using `!entry.plants_harvested`
  - Only uses actual planting records to determine planted count
  - Properly calculates remaining plants: planted - harvested
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:4444-4472` - Rewrote getCropPlantCount() to filter out harvest records
- **Result**: Grow bed summary now correctly shows remaining plants after harvest

#### 8. **Harvest Weight Unit Conversion** ⚖️
- **Issue**: Harvest weight showing as "1g" instead of "1kg" in Total Harvested summary
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Form accepts input in kg but was storing raw value without conversion
  - Database expected grams but received kg values (1 instead of 1000)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added kg to grams conversion (* 1000) when storing harvest data
  - Created `formatWeight()` function to display weights properly (1.0kg for values ≥1000g)
  - Updated existing database records to correct values
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:1328` - Added * 1000 conversion for harvest weight storage
  - `/script.js:4614-4626` - Added formatWeight() function
  - `/script.js:4238` - Updated display to use formatWeight()
  - Database: Updated existing harvest_weight values from kg to grams
- **Result**: Harvest weights now correctly display as kg/g based on value

#### 9. **Water Quality Parameters Enhancement** 💧
- **Issue**: Water quality system lacked humidity and salinity tracking capabilities
- **Solution**: 
  - Added humidity and salinity columns to water_quality table
  - Updated API endpoints to handle new parameters
  - Added humidity and salinity charts to both dashboard and plant tabs
  - Enhanced sensor data collection service to support new parameters
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/database/add-humidity-column.js` - Migration script for humidity column (executed, then deleted)
  - `/database/add-salinity-column.js` - Migration script for salinity column (executed, then deleted)
  - `/routes/data.js:103,114-116` - Updated POST endpoint to handle humidity/salinity
  - `/index.html` - Added humidity and salinity chart cards to dashboard and plant tabs
  - `/script.js:3183-3190` - Added chart initialization for new parameters
  - `/script.js:3291-3325` - Updated dashboard charts with new data
  - `/services/sensor-collector.js` - Added support for humidity/salinity sensors
- **Result**: Complete humidity and salinity tracking with charts, dashboard stats, and sensor integration

#### 10. **Chart Modal Recognition Fix** 🔧
- **Issue**: Clicking salinity chart caused JavaScript error "Unknown data field for dashboard modal"
- **Root Cause**: Modal function didn't recognize humidity and salinity as valid chart data fields
- **Solution**: Added humidity and salinity to recognized data fields in `openDashboardChartModal()`
- **Files Modified**: `/script.js:3261` - Added humidity and salinity to modal field recognition
- **Result**: All water quality chart modals now work correctly

#### 11. **Dashboard "No Data" Display Fix** 🎯
- **Issue**: pH and ammonia displayed "No data" on dashboard despite having valid historical data
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate `getLatestWaterQualityData()` functions - second simple version overrode composite version
- **Investigation**: 
  - Database contained valid pH=7.70 and ammonia=0.00 values in historical records
  - Most recent record had null values, but older records contained data
  - First function (line 2891) implemented composite logic to find most recent non-null values
  - Second function (line 12200) simply returned most recent record by date (with null values)
  - JavaScript function override caused wrong function to be used
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate simple function, keeping composite version that finds most recent non-null values
- **Files Modified**: `/script.js:12200-12208` - Removed duplicate getLatestWaterQualityData() function
- **Result**: Dashboard now correctly displays pH=7.7 and ammonia=0.0 from available historical data

#### 12. **Database Schema Verification** ✅
- **Task**: Verified migration from old water_quality nutrient columns to new nutrient_readings table
- **Findings**: 
  - New nutrient_readings table properly in use with source attribution (📡/📝/🧪 icons)
  - Humidity and salinity columns successfully added to water_quality table
  - Auto data flagging working correctly for sensor vs manual data
- **Result**: Database schema properly migrated and functioning as intended

#### 13. **Batch Move Functionality** ✅
- **Issue**: SVG batch move feature had multiple problems
  - Empty grow bed dropdown in move modal
  - API endpoint 404 errors (/plant-data not found)
  - Batch moves not visible after completion
- **Root Causes**: 
  - `generateBedOptions()` using incorrect API call method vs `getGrowBedsForSystem()`
  - `submitBatchMove()` using wrong endpoint and wrong approach (separate harvest/plant records)
  - Missing comprehensive data refresh after move
- **Solutions**: 
  - Fixed grow bed dropdown by using reliable `getGrowBedsForSystem()` method
  - Updated dropdown to show descriptive bed names with types: "Bed Name (Bed Type)"
  - Fixed API endpoint from `/plant-data` to `/data/plant-growth/${systemId}`
  - **Corrected batch move logic**: Use proper batch move endpoint `/data/batch/${systemId}/${batchId}/grow-bed` with PUT method
  - Enhanced post-move refresh: `loadDataRecords()`, `updatePlantOverview()`, `updateGrowBeds()`
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/script.js:10012-10025` - Enhanced `generateBedOptions()` debugging and API call
  - `/script.js:10017-10024` - Switched to `getGrowBedsForSystem()` method  
  - `/script.js:10036-10041` - Enhanced bed dropdown display with bed types
  - `/script.js:10117-10123` - Fixed API endpoint to use proper batch move endpoint
  - `/script.js:10150-10154` - Added comprehensive data refresh after move
- **Result**: Batch move functionality now works correctly with proper API calls, visible updates in SVG, and descriptive dropdown options

#### 13. **Grow Bed Configuration Forms Fix** 🔧
- **Issue**: Grow bed configuration forms in Settings → System Config → Grow Beds were not displaying despite function executing successfully
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate HTML element IDs - two `grow-beds-container` elements existed:
  - Line 725: In Plants tab (where JavaScript was adding forms)
  - Line 1500: In Settings tab (where user was looking for forms)
- **Investigation Process**:
  - Console logs showed function executing and HTML content increasing (1631 → 10635 → 14268 characters)
  - Created fallback functions and debugging - all worked but forms still invisible
  - Added extensive CSS overrides with `!important` - no effect
  - Finally identified duplicate ID issue causing forms to render in wrong container
- **Solution**: 
  - Renamed Settings container from `grow-beds-container` to `grow-beds-config-container` in HTML
  - Updated JavaScript `generateGrowBedConfiguration()` to target correct container
  - Updated CSS to style both container IDs
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/index.html:1500` - Changed ID to `grow-beds-config-container`
  - `/script.js:24064` - Updated container target in `generateGrowBedConfiguration()`
  - `/style.css:14010` - Added styling for new container ID
- **Result**: Grow bed configuration forms now display correctly with dropdowns for bed types and input fields for dimensions

#### 17. **Phase 3: Complete Forms & Input Standardization** ✅
- **Goal**: Standardize all form elements across the application to use the unified design system classes
- **Implementation**: Systematic replacement of inconsistent form classes with design system standards:
  - Replaced `modern-label`, `compact-label`, `setting-label` → `form-label`  
  - Replaced `modern-input`, `compact-input`, `current-value-input`, `plants-search-input` → `form-input`
  - Replaced `modern-select`, `plants-filter-select` → `form-input`
  - Replaced `modern-textarea` → `form-input`
- **Scope**: Updated form elements across all application areas:
  - Plant management forms (planting, harvest, search/filter)
  - System configuration forms (system name, tank/bed counts, dimensions)
  - Sensor configuration forms (device mapping, authentication)
  - User management forms (invitations, sharing, SMTP settings)  
  - Nutrient calculator current value inputs
  - Password reset form elements
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `/index.html` - 80+ form element updates across all tabs and modals
