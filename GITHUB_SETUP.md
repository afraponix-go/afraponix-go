# GitHub Setup Instructions

## 1. Create GitHub Repository
1. Go to GitHub.com and create a new repository
2. Name it: `afraponix-go` (or your preferred name)
3. Make it private if you want
4. Don't initialize with README (we already have one)

## 2. Add Remote and Push
Your GitHub repository URL is ready:

```bash
# Add GitHub as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/justdabug/afraponix-go.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 3. Alternative SSH Setup (if you have SSH keys configured)
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:justdabug/afraponix-go.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Repository is Ready
- Initial commit contains all application code
- Sensitive files (database, logs, SMTP config) are properly ignored
- Ready for VPS deployment
